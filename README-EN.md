## Confirm Network and Hardware Support for IPv6  

IPv6 requires both network and hardware support to function properly.  

### Hardware Support  

> This section applies to Windows systems.  
> Most modern network adapters support IPv6, but manual configuration may be required.  

1. Open the **Control Panel** → **Network and Internet** → **Network and Sharing Center**.  
2. Click **Change adapter settings** on the left to open the **Network Connections** page.

Locate your active network connection (e.g., **WLAN** for Wi-Fi or **Ethernet** for wired connections).  

Right-click the connection and select **Properties**. Ensure **Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)** is checked.  
> If this option is missing, your network adapter may not support IPv6. Check your adapter specifications.

### Network Support  

After enabling IPv6 on your hardware, test connectivity via websites like http://testipv6.com/.  
If all tests pass, your network supports IPv6. Otherwise, proceed with the following steps.  

> [!WARNING]  
> Do not proceed if using a public network!  

### Router Configuration  
> Example: Huawei Router AX2 Pro. Settings may vary by brand.  

1. Access your router’s admin page (check the router’s label for the address).  
2. Navigate to **Advanced Settings** → **Network Settings** → **IPv6** and enable IPv6.

Save changes. If IPv6 still fails, check your optical modem settings.  

### Optical Modem/Direct Cable Connection  
> Example: China Mobile Optical Modem. Settings vary by ISP.  

For direct connections or unresolved router issues:  
1. Access the modem’s admin page (typically `192.168.1.1`; credentials are on the modem label).  
2. Go to **Status** → **Network Information** → **IPv6 Connection Details**. If no IPv6 data appears, contact your ISP.

> [!NOTE]  
> ISPs now use dynamic admin passwords, rendering older tutorials obsolete.  

Re-test IPv6 connectivity after configuration.

## Prioritize IPv6  

If Spotify/Lyricify remains inaccessible despite IPv6 activation, adjust priority settings.  

### Verify Connectivity  
1. Open **Command Prompt** (`Win + R` → `cmd` → Enter).  
2. Run:  
   ```cmd  
   ping -6 api.spotify.com  
   ping -6 accounts.spotify.com  
   ```  

Successful replies indicate IPv6 connectivity.  

### Check IPv6 Priority  
1. Open **Command Prompt**.  
2. Run:  
   ```cmd  
   netsh interface ipv6 show prefixpolicies  
   ```  
   - Higher "Precedence" values indicate higher priority.  
   - Ensure `::/0` (IPv6) has higher precedence than `::/96` or `::ffff:0:0/96` (IPv4).  

If IPv6 priority is lower, follow the [Force Windows to Globally Prioritize IPv6](/IPv6First-EN.md) guide.<br>
Or use the [one-click script](https://github.com/MiaowCham/How_to_connect_Spotify_with_IPv6/releases/latest).  

> [!note]  
> Settings reset after rebooting. Re-run the script or reapply settings post-reboot.  

If issues persist, double-check all steps to ensure proper IPv6 configuration.
